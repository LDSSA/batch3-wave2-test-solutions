# batch3-wave2-test-solutions

This repo contains proposed solutions for the wave#2 admission test for batch3 of the LDSSA.

The test was done through [Stepik](https://stepik.org), which is an e-learning platform.
The test is now publicly available, but you still need a Stepik account to access it.

You can check the test (and it's questions) [here](https://stepik.org/course/54405).


### What were we testing in the background?

For each question, we added a tests file with all the assertions that we were doing on Stepik.

You can run the tests using pytest. Go to the root of the project and type:

```
pytest
```

If you want to understand why your code wasn't passing the grader, you can use these tests to figure it out!
