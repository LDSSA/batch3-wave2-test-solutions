# batch3-wave2-test-solutions

This repo contains proposed solutions for the wave#2 admission test for batch3 of the LDSSA.

The test was done through [Stepik](https://stepik.org), which is an e-learning platform.
The test is now publicly available, but you still need a Stepik account to access it.

You can check the test (and it's questions) [here](https://stepik.org/course/54405).

This repo already has most of the relevant information, but it's still WIP :)


### What were we testing in the background?

For some questions, we added a tests file with all the assertions that we were doing on Stepik.

Example, for Exercise 4, Step 1.
We have a proposed solution in file exercise_4/step_1.py and the test in exercise_4/test_step_1.py.

You can run the tests using pytest.
